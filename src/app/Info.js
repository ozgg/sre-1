            <p>
                I am a full-stack developer currently using ruby on rails
                and vanilla JS with elements of React. I started by web-related
                career in 1997 and has been in touch with lots of different
                technologies. Current plan: react, redux, typescript, docker.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I practice dreaming, photography, used to compose music.
                Current focus is mostly my son.
